FLAC is an Open Source lossless audio codec developed by Josh Coalson from 2001
to 2009.

From January 2012 FLAC is being maintained by Erik de Castro Lopo under the
auspices of the Xiph.org Foundation.

FLAC is comprised of
  * `libFLAC', a library which implements reference encoders and
    decoders for native FLAC and Ogg FLAC, and a metadata interface
  * `libFLAC++', a C++ object wrapper library around libFLAC
  * `flac', a command-line program for encoding and decoding files
  * `metaflac', a command-line program for viewing and editing FLAC
    metadata
  * player plugin for XMMS
  * user and API documentation

The libraries (libFLAC, libFLAC++) are
licensed under Xiph.org's BSD-like license (see COPYING.Xiph).  All other
programs and plugins are licensed under the GNU General Public License
(see COPYING.GPL).  The documentation is licensed under the GNU Free
Documentation License (see COPYING.FDL).

This project is fork from xiph/flac
And it is striped to complied with encoder only for libFLAC
